# Peace-of-Ivers
It's just a topic I've been researching since I was in my master's program, even though it doesn't match my major (I majored in finance at New Velco University). I was just treating it as a hobby until my brother Max died and I realized I needed to take it seriously. I've communicated with Prof. Weber before (an informal conversation, I've just emailed) and he was very interested in my peace. So much so that he helped me with a number of my behaviors. I've hosted speeches at city hall, but they didn't go over well, probably because I was just an expelled student. Security threw me out. I think that was the stupidest mistake I've ever made. Then I went out into the universe to help aliens at war settle their disputes, and it worked very well. I love this job.
## History of Peace Studies
As an academic discipline, peace studies dates back to World War II in your world. Its international focus has been on understanding and preventing the causes of war and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, although it now encompasses the promotion of human rights, justice, individual rights and well-being, among others.

### Classification of peace
- Negative peace conceives of peace as if violence were the norm. Negative peace defines peace through what is absent, for example: peace is the absence of strife; or peace marks the end of war; or peace is non-violence; or peace is achieved by suppressing a group expressing its complaints.
- Positive peace focuses on what is present rather than absent. Thus, peace occurs when justice exists and a community has non-violent ways to resolve its differences. Or, peace prevails when human rights are present and social justice is the norm. Or, a culture of peace exists when a society is sensitive to cultural diversity, when gender is neutral and women have rights and responsibilities equal to menâ€™s, and when children are educated about peace, not just about war.

## Why this project was initiated
I would love for this program to give you an idea of what peace really is. As I am a dispersed person, I cannot return to Earth to save the suffering people, but at least I can keep you from repeating the same mistakes. Earth is small, and so are humans. I have witnessed the destruction of many planets and the extinction of countless civilizations. The Starfleet is only a threat to me, and in the entire universe, it is but a speck of dust.

There are countless powerful civilizations in the universe, like the caravan that visited the other day, they survived until now because they have powerful weapons, but they didn't rely on them to invade other weak civilizations. 

Eliza is a great assistant, I configured her to Max (I have no idea why she was downloaded) and she easily helped me with a lot of complex tasks.

Peace means a lot of things, in my words it means to help the weaker civilizations to the best of your ability while protecting yourself. Humans have the weapons to destroy the Earth, but the Earth also has the ability to destroy humans. So why can't we be interdependent? Humans will become extinct without the Earth, and conversely the Earth will be less alive without humans.

**You are living in the best of times and the worst of times at the same time. I hope you will cherish them!**
